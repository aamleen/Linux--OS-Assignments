Q2, part c:
Compiling Instructions: make Q2c
Executing Instructions: ./Q2c
Then follow the instructions as per the menu of instructions given on the interactive console. Enter those values only that are asked. You can opt to perform operations in a stack or queue

Q3:
Compiling Instructions: make Q3
Executing Instructions: ./Q3 <opration_name> <operand1> <operand2>
Its a command line argument, so just use the operation name as given in question, and then pass 2 arguments, space separated every value.
eg- ./Q3 sub 5 7  Other operation names are: add, sub, mul, div, exp
